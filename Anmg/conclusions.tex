\section{Conclusions}
ANMG-DSA preconditioning is much more efficient than DSA preconditioning when
the scattering kernel is highly forward peaked. Unlike MM, the number of 
iterations needed to solve a problem with ANMG-DSA does not saturate as the 
anisotropy increases. However, whereas the extra work due to the additional
sweeps for MM is at most equivalent to the work done during the sweeps of a
standard iteration, the extra work for ANMG-DSA is at most a sweep on 
$\frac{n^2}{6}+n$ different directions. This number must be compared to the 
$\frac{n^2}{2}+n$ directions of a standard iteration. Thus, ANMG-DSA becomes 
cheaper compared to standard iteration as the anisotropy order increases.
