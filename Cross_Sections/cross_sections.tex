\section{Cross sections}
\subsection{Physics of the interactions}

\begin{description}
\item [Thomson scattering :] an electron, assumed to be free, oscillates
classically in response to the electric vector of a passing electromagnetic
wave. The oscillating electron promptly emits photons of the same frequency as
the incident wave. The net effect of Thomson scattering is the redirection of
some incident photons with no transfer of energy to the medium. Thomson
scattering represents the low-energy limit of Compton scattering, as the
incident photon energy approaches zero \cite{radiation}.
\item [Raleigh scattering :] the scattering results from the combined,
coherent action of an atom as a whole. The scattering angle is usually very
small. There is no appreciable loss of energy by the photon to the atom,
which, however, does ``recoil" enough to conserve momentum \cite{radiation}.
\item [photo-electric effect :] a photon undergoes an interaction with an
absorber atom in which the photon disappears. An energetic photoelectron is
ejected from one of the bound shells of the atom. For gamma rays of
sufficient energy, the most probable origin of the photoelectron is the $K$
shell of the atom. The photoelectron appears with an energy given by :
\begin{equation}
E_{e^-} = h\nu -E_b
\end{equation}
where $E_b$ represents the binding energy of the photoelectron in its original
shell. The interaction leaves an ionized absorber atom with a vacancy in one
of its bound shells. This hole is quickly filled through the rearrangement of
electrons from other shells of the atom. Therefore, one or more X-ray photons
may also be generated. In some fraction of the cases, the emission of Auger
electrons may substitute for the X-ray. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./Cross_Sections/images/photoelectric}
\caption{Photoelectric effect}
\end{figure}
The photoelectric process is the
predominant mode of interaction for photons of relatively low energy. The
process is more important for high atomic number $Z$.The probability of
photoelectric absorption $\tau$ depends on $Z$ and $h\nu$ as :
\begin{equation}
\tau \propto \frac{Z^n}{\(h\nu\)^3}
\end{equation}
where $n$ varies between 4 and 5. The photoelectric interaction is most likely
to occur if the energy of the incident photon is just greater than the binding
energy of the electron with which it interacts.
\item [fluorescence :] fluorescence is a process in which some of the energy
of a photon is used to create a second photon of less energy.
\item [Compton effect :]  a Compton interaction is one in which only a portion
of the energy is absorbed and a photon is produced with reduced energy. This
photon leaves the site of the interaction in a different direction from that
of the original photon. If a photon of energy $h\nu$ and momentum
$\frac{h\nu}{c}$ is a incident on a stationary, free electron, after the
collision, the photon is scattered at an angle $\theta$ with energy $h\nu'$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./Cross_Sections/images/compton}
\caption{Compton effect}
\end{figure}
The Compton shift is given by :
\begin{equation}
\Delta \lambda = \lambda'-\lambda = \frac{h}{mc} \(1-\cos \theta\)
\end{equation}
The Klein-Nishina formal gives the differential cross section of photons
scattered from a single free electron :
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \sigma}{d\bo} = \frac{k_0^2 e^4}{2 m_e^2
c^4}\(\frac{\nu'}{\nu}\)^2\(\frac{\nu}{\nu'}+\frac{\nu'}{\nu}-\sin^e \theta\)
m^e sr^{-1}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{d\Sigma}{d\bo}$ is the differential scattering cross sections,
$k_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}$, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity,
$e$ is the elementary charge, $m_e$ is the mass of an electron and $c$ is the
speed of light in vacuum \cite{radiation}.
\item [Auger electron :] an atom in which an L electron makes a transition to
fill a vacancy in the K shell does not always emit a photon. An other L
electron can be ejected from the atom, thereby leaving two vacancies on the L
shell. The electron eject by the atom is called an Auger electron.
Auger-electron emission is favored over photon emission for elements of low
atomic number. The original inner-shell vacancy in an Auger-electron emitter
can be created by orbital electron capture, internal conversion, or
photoelectric effect. Auger cascades can occur in relatively heavy atoms, as
inner-shell vacancies are successively filled by the Auger process, with
simultaneous ejections of the more loosely bound atomic electrons.
\item [Bremsstrahlung :] is an electromagnetic radiation produced by a sudden
slowing down or deflection of charged particle (especially electrons) passing
through matter in the vicinity of the strong electric fields of atomic nuclei.
The efficiency of bremsstrahlung in elements of different atomic number $Z$
varies nearly as $Z^2$.
\item [Collisional stopping power :] the collisional stopping power for
electrons and positrons can be \hbox{written :}
\begin{equation}
\(-\frac{dE}{dx}\)_{col}^{\pm} = \frac{4\pi k_0^2 e^4 n}{m_e c^2 \beta^2}
\[\ln \(\frac{m_e c^2 \tau \sqrt{\tau+2}}{\sqrt{2}I}\)+F^{\pm}\(\beta\)\]
\end{equation}
where :
\begin{equation}
F^-(\beta) = \frac{1-\beta^2}{2} \[1+\frac{\tau^2}{8} - (2\tau +1 )\ln 2\]
\end{equation}
is used for electrons and :
\begin{equation}
F^+\(\beta\) = \ln 2 - \frac{\beta^2}{24} \[23 + \frac{14}{\tau +2} +
\frac{10}{\(\tau + 2\)^2} + \frac{4}{\(\tau + 2\)^2}\]
\end{equation}       
for positrons. Here $n$ is number of electrons per unit volume in the medium,
$\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ is the speed of the particle relative to $c$, $I$ is the
mean excitation energy of the medium and $\tau = \frac{T}{m_e c^2}$ is the
kinetic energy $T$ of the particle expressed in multiples of the electron rest
energy $mc^2$.
\item[radiative stopping power :] At high beta-particle energies, the
radiation is emitted mostly in the forward direction, that is, in the direction
of travel if the beta particle. Unlike collisional energy losses, no single
analytic formula exists for calculating the radiative stopping power. At high
energies bremsstrahlung becomes the predominant mechanism of energy loss for
beta particles. The following approximate formula gives the ratio of radiative
and collisional stopping powers for an electron of total energy $E$, expressed
in MeV, in an element of atomic number \hbox{$Z$ :}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\(\frac{dE}{dx}\)_{rad}^-}{\(\frac{dE}{dx}\)_{col}^-} \approx
\frac{ZE}{800}
\end{equation}
At very high energies the dominance of radiative over collisional energy
losses gives rise to electron-photon cascade showers. Since bremsstrahlung
photon spectrum is approximately flat out to its maximum (equal to the
electron's kinetic energy), high-energy beta particles emit high-energy
photons. These, in turn, produce Compton electrons and electron-positron
pairs, which then produce additional bremsstrahlung photons, and so on. These
repeated interactions result in an electron-photon cascade shower, which can
be initiated by either a high-energy beta particle or a photon.
\end{description}

\subsection{CEPXS}
The principal interactions that electrons and photons can have, are
\cite{cepxs} :
\begin{description}
\item [electron-to-electron :] collisional scattering, knock-on production,
radiative scattering, elastic scattering and Auger production following impact
ionization.
\item [electron-to-photon :] bremsstrahlung production and fluorescence
production following impact ionization.
\item [photon-to-photon :] incoherent scattering, coherent scattering (Thomson 
scattering and Raleigh scattering) and fluorescence production following
photoionization.
\item [photon-to-electron :] photoelectric production, Compton electron
production, pair production and Auger production following photoionization.
\item [photon-to-positron :] pair production.
\item [positron-positron :] collisional scattering, radiative scattering and
elastic scattering.
\item [positron-to-photon :] bremsstrahlung production, fluorescence
production following impact ionization and annihilation radiation.
\item [positron-to-electron :] knock-on production and Auger production
following impact ionization.
\end{description}
CEPXS is a multigroup Coupled Electron-Photon cross-section (XS) generating
code. CEPXS was created to \cite{cepxs} :
\begin{itemize}
\item generate coupled electron-photon cross sections which can be used by
standard discrete ordinates code to solve electron-photon transport
calculations
\item model the same physical interactions as Version 2.1 of the
Integrated-TIGER-Series (ITS) code package.
\end{itemize}
Now we define \cite{barjon} :
\begin{itemize}
\item $\sigma$ is the microscopic cross section. It is the mean probability than a
particle interacts whit a nucleus per $cm^2$. The unit of $\sigma$ is the barn
which is $10^{-24}cm^2$.
\item $\Sigma$ is the macroscopic cross section. $\Sigma = N \sigma$ where $N$
is the number of atoms per $cm^3$. The unit of $\Sigma$ is $cm^{-1}$.
\end{itemize}
In CEPXS, most cross sections for compounds are constructed using \cite{cepxs} :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{comp} = \sum_i w_i \Sigma_i
\end{equation}
where $w_i$ is the weight fraction of the $i^{th}$ element in the compound.
However, the collisional stopping power of a compound cannot be expressed a
combination of elemental stopping powers.\\
The multigroup method involves a discretization of the particle energy domain
into energy groups :
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./Cross_Sections/images/multigroup}
\caption{Multigroup}
\end{figure}        
where E1 $>$ E2 $>$ E3 $>$ $\cdots$ $>$ EG $>$ EG+1. EG+1 is the cutoff
energy. In CEPXS, different groups structures can be selected for photons and
electrons but the upper boundary energy and the cutoff energy are the same.\\
The multigroup angular flux, $\Psi^g\(\br,\bo\)$, is defined as :
\begin{equation}
\Psi^g\(\br,\bo\) = \int_{E^{g+1}}^{E^g} dE \Psi\(\br,\bo,E\)
\end{equation}
where $\Psi(\br,\bo,E)$ is the angular flux. The differential cross section,
$\Sigma_s(\br,E\rightarrow E',\mu)$ can be represented as :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_s(\br,E\rightarrow E',\mu) = \sum_{l}^{\infty} \frac{2l+1}{4\pi}
\Sigma_{s,l}(\br,E\rightarrow E') P_l(\mu)
\end{equation}
where :
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Sigma_{s,l}(r,E\rightarrow E') &= \int_{4 \pi} d\bo \Sigma_s\(\br,E\rightarrow
E',\mu\) P_l(\mu)\\
&= 2\pi \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \Sigma_s(\br,E\rightarrow,\mu) P_l\(\mu\)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and $P_l$ are the Legendre polynomials. The multigroup-Legendre expansion
coefficients for the cross sections that describe scattering and production
interactions are stored by CEPXS in transfer matrices. For a differential
cross section, the expansion coefficients that are stored in the transfer
matrix of $L^{th}$-order are :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{s,L}^{g\rightarrow g'}\(\br\) = \frac{\int_{E^{g+1}}^{E^g} dE w(E)
\int_{E^{g'+1}}^{E^{g'}}} dE' \Sigma_{s,L}(\br,E\rightarrow
E'){\int_{E^{g+1}}^{E^g} dE w(E)}
\end{equation}
where $w(E)$ is the multigroup weighting function. $g$ is the row index of the
transfer matrix and $g'$ is the column index. In CEPXS the weighting function
is piece-wise constant in energy :
\begin{equation}
w(E) = c^g \textrm{ for } E^{g}\geq E \geq E^{g+1}
\end{equation}
where $c^g$ is a group-dependent constant. Therefore, the multigroup-Legendre
expansion coefficients become :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{s,L}^{g \rightarrow g'}\(\br\) = \frac{\int_{E^{g+1}}^{E^g}dE
\int_{E^{g'+1}}^{E^{g'}}dE' \Sigma_{s,L}\(\br,E \rightarrow E'\)}{\Delta E^g}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta E^g = E^g - E^{g+1}$.

The five types of reaction cross sections assembled by CEPXS are : total
$\(\Sigma_t\)$, absorption $\(\Sigma_a\)$, secondary production
$\(\Sigma_S\)$, energy deposition $\(\Sigma_E\)$ and charge deposition
$\(\Sigma_C\)$. For a reaction type $X$, the multigroup reaction rate is :
\begin{equation}
R_X^g = \int d\br \Sigma_X^g \Phi^g\(\br\)
\end{equation}
The reaction rate over all groups is :
\begin{equation}
R_X = \int_{g=1}^G R_X^g
\end{equation}
Energy-deposition cross sections are associated with every type of
interaction. These cross sections are defined as the net energy deposited in
the medium due to the interactions of particles in a group per unit
pathlength. These cross sections have units of energy per distance. The
energy-deposition multigroup cross sections for a scattering interaction could
be computed by :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{E,s}^g(\br) = \frac{\int_{E^{g+1}}^{E^g} dE' E
\Sigma_{s,0}(\br,E\rightarrow E') - \int_{E^{k+1}}^{E^k} dE \int_{E^{k+1}}^E
dE' E' \Sigma_{s,0}(\br,E\rightarrow E')}{\Delta E^g}
\end{equation}
However, it is not what is done in CEPXS where an effective energy-deposition
multigroup cross sections is defined :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{E,s}^g\(\br\) = \Sigma_{t,s}^g \(\br,E^{g,m}\) - \sum_{g'=1}^G
\Sigma_{s,0}^{g\rightarrow g'}\(E^{g',m}\)
\end{equation}
where $E^{g,m}$ is the midpoint energy of group $g$ and $\Sigma_{t,s}^g$ are
the total scattering multigroup cross \hbox{sections :}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{t,s}^g = \frac{\int_{E^{g+1}}^{E^g} dE \int_{E^{min}}^E dE'
\Sigma_{s,0} \(\br,E \rightarrow E'\)}{\Delta E^g}
\end{equation}
with the assumption that :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{s,0}(\br,E\rightarrow E') = 0 \textrm{     for }E' < E_{min}
\end{equation}
We can notice that :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{t,s}^g\(\br\) = \sum_{g'=1}^G \Sigma_{s,0}^{g \rightarrow g'}(\br)
\end{equation}
only when $E^{min} > E^{g+1}$

\subsubsection{Catastrophic collisional scattering}       
In CEPXS, inelastic scattering due to catastrophic collisions are modelled by
the M\o ller microscopic cross section, $\sigma^{CC}$. One of the assumptions
used in the derivation of the M\o ller cross section is that the incident
electron collides with a free atomic electron. The adequacy of this assumption
depends on how the energy of the incident electron compares to the binding
energy of the atomic electron with which it collides. For example, if the
incident-electron energy is on the order if the binding energy of an electron,
the assumption of zero binding is wrong. After an inelastic collision, two
electrons emerge. By convention, the particle with the higher energy is
considered to be the primary electron. The electron is the knock-on electron.
The M\o ller cross section can be written as differential tin the energy of
the knock-on electron. The microscopic form of this cross section, in units of
$cm^2$ per reduced electron energy, per collision with an atomic electron is
given by :
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma^{CC}\(\br,\tau,\epsilon\)}{d\epsilon} = \frac{2 \pi r_0^2}{\beta^2}
\[\frac{1}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{1}{\tau_p^2} + \frac{1}{\(\tau+1\)^2} -
\frac{2\tau +1}{\(\tau+1\)^2\epsilon \tau_p}\]
\end{equation}
where $\tau_p$ is the kinetic energy of the scattered primary electron in
units of reduced energy, $\tau_p$ varies from $\frac{\tau_p}{2}$ to $\tau$.
$\epsilon$ is energy lost by the incident electron in units of reduced energy.
It is equivalent to the kinetic energy of the knock-on electron in reduced
energy units. Since the knock-on energy is the difference between the energies
$\tau$ and $\tau_p$, $\epsilon$ varies from 0 to $\frac{\tau}{2}$. $r_0$ is
the classical electron radius.\\
\red{The macroscopic M\o ller cross section for a material is :}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Sigma^N(\br,\tau,\epsilon)}{d\epsilon} = \(\frac{Z}{A}\)_{eff} N_A
\frac{d\sigma^{CC}\(\br,\tau,\epsilon\)}{d\epsilon}
\end{equation}
where the expression in brackets is defined in the glossary. Because energy
and angle are kinematically related, the M\o ller cross section that is
differential in both energy and angle is :
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Sigma^{CC}(\br)}{d\tau_p d\bo_p} = \frac{d\Sigma^{CC}(\br)}{d\tau_p}
\frac{1}{2\pi} \delta(\mu-\mu_p)
\end{equation}
The total cross section for a catastrophic collision is obtained by
integrating the differential cross sections over all possible energies and
angles at which primary electrons can emerge. Because the M\o ller cross
section is singular is at $\epsilon = 0$, tis integration must be truncated at
a primary electron energy that corresponds to a non-zero knock-on energy,
$\epsilon^{CC}$ :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_t^M\(\br,\tau\) = \int_{\frac{\tau}{2}}^{\tau-\epsilon^{CC}} d\tau_p
\int_{4\pi} d\bo_p \frac{d\Sigma^{CC}(\br)}{d\tau_p d\bo_p}
\end{equation}
The energy, $\epsilon^{CC}$, is the smallest energy that knock-on electron is
allowed to have as a result of a catastrophic collision. Collisions that
produce primary electrons with energy less than $\tau-\epsilon^{CC}$ are called
catastrophic. $\epsilon^{CC}$ is chosen such that, in catastrophic collisions,
primary electrons appear in energy groups that are non-adjacent to the energy
group of the incident particle. For example, for an electron with energy
$\tau$ in group $g$, $\epsilon^{CC} = \tau -\tau_{g+2}$. $\epsilon^{CC}$ depends on
both the kinetic energy of the incident electron and the group structure.
While the energy, $\epsilon^{CC}$, cannot be less than the smallest width of an
electron energy group, it may be less than the cutoff energy. The restriction
of catastrophic collisions to transfer between non-adjacent energy groups is
required to insure that, in a multigroup formalism, $\epsilon^{CC}$ is never
zero. If scattering into adjacent energy groups were allowed, $\epsilon^{CC}$
would equal $\tau - \tau^{g+1}$. Since the kinetic energies of electrons in a
group can assume any value between $\tau^g$ and $\tau^{g+1}$, $\epsilon^{CC}$
could assume the value of zero if catastrophic collisions into adjacent energy
groups were allowed. The total cross sections associated with catastrophic
collisions are :
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Sigma_{t}^{CC,g}\(\br\) &= \frac{1}{\Delta \tau^g} \int_{\tau^{g+1}}^{\tau^g}d\tau
\int_{\frac{\tau}{2}}^{\tau^{g+2}} d\tau_p \int_{4\pi} d\bo_p
\frac{d\Sigma^{CC}\(\br,T,T_p\)}{d\tau_p d\bo_p}\\
&= \frac{1}{\Delta \tau_p} \int_{\tau^{g+1}}^{\tau^g} d\tau
\int_{frac{\tau}{2}}^{\tau^{g+2}}d\tau_p \frac{d\Sigma^{CC}\(\br,\tau,\tau_p\)}{d\tau_p}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The effective energy deposition cross sections due to catastrophic collisions
are :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{E}^{CC,g}\(\br\) = \Sigma_{t,s}^{CC,g}\(\br\) E^{m,g} - \sum_{g' >
g}\Sigma_{s,0}^{CC,g \rightarrow g'}\(\br\) E^{m,g'}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Knock-on electron production}
Knock-on electrons are defined to be the least energetic electrons that emerge
following an inelastic collision. In CEPXS, the minimum energy that a knock-on
electron can possess is the cutoff energy. Most of the primary electrons
scattered in a catastrophic collision will be correlated in energy with a
knock-on electron. However, the extent of this correlation is limited by the
electron energy domain that is selected by the user of the code. If
$\epsilon^{CC}$ is less than the cutoff energy, not every primary electron
scattered in a catastrophic collision is associated with a knock-on electron.
There is no energy correlation between knock-on electrons and electrons that
lose energy as a result of soft collisions. This is because, in the CSD
approximation, individual soft collisions are not resolved. Nonetheless, if
$\epsilon^{CC}$ is greater than the cutoff energy, those knock-ons that are
generated with energy between $\tau^{G+1}$ and $\epsilon^{CC}$ must be
associated with soft collisions, even if a direct energy correlation is
absent.\\
The microscopic M\o ller cross section differential in the energy of the
knock-on electron, $\sigma^K$, associated with a collision with an atomic
electron is given \hbox{by :}
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma^K\(\br\)}{d\epsilon d\bo_s} = \frac{d\sigma^K\(\br\)}{d\epsilon}
\frac{1}{2\pi} \delta\(\mu-\mu_s\)
\end{equation}
In order for electrons in group $g$ to produce knock-on electrons in group
$g'$, the lowest energy of the lower energy group $\tau^{g'+1}$ must not
exceed the maximum knock-on energy $\frac{\tau^g}{2}$. The expansion
coefficients of the $l^th$-order transfer matrix for knock-on electron
production are :
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{s,l}^{K,g\rightarrow g'}\(\br\) = \frac{1}{\tau^g} \int_{\tau^{g+1}}^{\tau^g}
d\tau \int_{\tau^{g'+1}}^{\min\(\tau^{g'},\frac{\tau}{2}\)} d\epsilon
\nu\(\Delta \epsilon\) P_l\(\mu_s\)
\frac{d\sigma^k\(\br,\tau,\epsilon\)}{d\epsilon}
\end{equation}
where the argument of the Heaviside function $\nu$ is :
\begin{equation}
\Delta \epsilon = \min\(\tau^{g'},\frac{\tau}{2}\)-\tau^{g'+1}
\end{equation}
\red{The macroscopic transfer matrices for knock-on production are :}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{s,l}^{K,g\rightarrow g'}\(\br\) = \(\frac{Z}{A}\)_{eff} N_A
\sigma_{s,l}^{K,g\rightarrow g'}\(\br\)
\end{equation}
The effective energy deposition cross sections due to knock-on production
\hbox{are :}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{E}^{K,g}\(\br\) = - \sum_{g' > g} \Sigma_{s,0}^{K,g\rightarrow
g'}(\br) E^{m,g'}
