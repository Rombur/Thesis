\section{Conclusions} \label{sec_conc}
We have adapted the MIP-DSA to PieceWise Linear Discontinuous finite elements
and proposed a simple way to compute the penalty coefficient which allows the
use of MIP on arbitrary polygonal meshes. The advantage of polygonal cells 
being the potential reduction 
of the numbers of unknowns and the possibility to use adaptive mesh refinement 
without having hanging nodes. We have performed two Fourier analysis of the
new MIP-DSA on rectangular cell and shown that MIP is always stable when the
scattering is isotropic. On different examples, we tested MIP on highly
unstructured meshed composed of different types of cells. We noticed that the
efficiency of MIP does not seem to be degraded on these meshes. We have also
compared different preconditioners for CG to solve MIP. Algebraic multigrid
methods were found to be the best preconditioner, AGMG being up to 20 times
faster than CG without preconditioning which itself was faster than CG
preconditioned by SSOR.
