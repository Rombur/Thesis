\chapter{\uppercase{Modified Interior Penalty on Arbitrary Polygonal Cells}}
\section{Introduction}
In the previous Chapter, we saw that at the coarsest level of ANMG a Diffusion
Synthetic Acceleration needs to be solved. DSA is very often used to speed up the
calculation when the scattering is isotropic or weakly anisotropic. This is
because the transport sweep attenuates the quickly varying error modes whereas
the diffusion operator attenuates the slowly varying error modes.  Another
important property of the diffusion operator is that it is easily inverted. 
In this Chapter, we introduce the Modified Interior Penalty DSA on arbitrary 
polygonal mesh. Several discretization methods haven been developed for 
arbitrary polygonal meshes \cite{pwld_3d,pwl_diffusion,palmer_fe,mimetic,
cell_centered_diff,palmer_proc,palmer_ane,pwld_2d,wachspress}. Using polygonal 
cells can be advantageous because the number of unknowns can be reduced while 
maintaining symmetry within the mesh. This potential reduction in the number of 
unknowns can be seen by comparing a hexagonal cell with a triangular 
discretization of the same area:

\end{figure}
If there is one unknown per vertex, the hexagonal cell will have only six
unknowns compared to the twelve unknowns of the triangular discretization. Another 
advantage of polygonal cells is that they can be used for adaptive mesh 
refinement (AMR) \cite{amr_block,amr_rad,amr_unstruc} without having to
deal with hanging nodes \cite{locally_hanging_nodes,arbitrary_hanging_nodes,
dealII_hanging_nodes}. On the figure below, the left cell is a pentagon 
whereas the two cells on the right are quadrilaterals:

Among the different discretization schemes for polygonal meshes, the PieceWise 
Linear Discontinuous (PWLD) finite elements \cite{pwld_3d,pwld_2d} 
have been successfully used to solve the transport equation on arbitrary
polygonal meshes. Another variant of the PieceWise Linear finite elements, the
PieceWise Linear Continuous finite elements were also developed and used 
to discretize the diffusion equation. They have shown to be second order and to
produce a symmetric positive matrix \cite{pwl_diffusion}. However, no 
DSA \cite{dsa_ref,larsen_dsa,consistent_p1} 
was developed using this discretization. In this work, we remedy this lack by 
adapting the Modified Interior Penalty (MIP) DSA developed in \cite{mip} for 
triangular cells. By using PWLD finite elements with MIP, MIP will be able to 
to be used on arbitrary polygonal cells. Since MIP produces SPD equations, it 
has usually been solved using conjugate gradient preconditioned by SSOR. In 
this work, the effectiveness of algebraic multigrid methods (AMG) to precondition 
the Krylov solver \cite{amg,amg_course} will be tested. Algebraic multigrid methods 
allow to use multigrid techniques when there is no grid or when the mesh is 
unstructured. Instead of using a succession of grids based on the geometry of the 
problems, the grids are based on properties of the matrix. Therefore, AMG can
be used as black-box solver or preconditioner.
