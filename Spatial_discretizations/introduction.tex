\chapter{\uppercase{A Brief Review of $S_n$ Transport: Iterative Techniques
and Discretization on Arbitrary Polygons}} \label{spatial_chapter}
\section{Introduction}                      
In this Chapter, we briefly recall the $S_n$ transport equations before presenting 
our research in the next Chapters. Here, we review the standard iterative 
techniques employed to solve the $S_n$ transport equations and discuss their 
spatial discretization on arbitrary polygonal grids using a discontinuous 
finite element method (DFEM).
  
In the following presentation, we restrict ourselves to one-group equations
with isotropic scattering and source. With these simplifying assumptions,
the fundamentals of $S_n$ transport iterative solution techniques and
spatial discretization can be presented effectively, while leaving new
research material for subsequent Chapters. These next Chapters will build
upon the concepts laid out here.

Here, we introduce the two spatial discretizations used
in this research: the BiLinear Discontinuous finite elements (BLD) 
\cite{thick_dgfem,lumping_bld} and the PieceWise Linear Discontinuous finite 
elements (PWLD) \cite{pwld_3d,pwld_2d}. The BLD discretization is being used on
rectangular cells whereas PWLD is being used on arbitrary convex polygonal
cells. Both of these discretizations give the correct result in the diffusion 
limit.
