\chapter{\uppercase{A Brief Review of $S_n$ Transport: Iterative Techniques
and Discretization on Arbitrary Polygons}} \label{spatial_chapter}
\section{Introduction}                      
In this Chapter, we briefly recall the $S_n$ transport equations before presenting 
our research in the next Chapters. We review the standard iterative 
techniques employed to solve the $S_n$ transport equations and we introduce the 
two spatial discretizations used in this research: the BiLinear Discontinuous 
finite elements (BLD) \cite{thick_dgfem,lumping_bld} and the PieceWise Linear 
Discontinuous finite elements (PWLD) \cite{pwld_3d,pwld_2d}. The BLD 
discretization is used on rectangular cells whereas PWLD is used 
on arbitrary convex polygonal cells. Both of these discretizations give the 
correct result in the diffusion limit. 

In the following presentation, we restrict ourselves to one-group equations
with isotropic scattering and source. With these simplifying assumptions,
the fundamentals of $S_n$ transport iterative solution techniques and
spatial discretization can be presented effectively, while leaving new
research material for subsequent Chapters. These next Chapters will build
upon the concepts laid out here.
