\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\addcontentsline{doc}{part}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\indent I would like to thank my advisors Dr. Jean Ragusa and Dr. Jim Morel. 
They helped me in my research since the very beginning and are a real
source of inspiration for me. I also would like to thank Dr. Wolfgang Bangerth 
for all the useful discussions we had over the years.

\indent I am also grateful to all the people who made my life in College
Station better: Yaqi Wang, Vijay Mahadevan, Tara Pandya, Michael Adams, Fabien
Auffret, Marco Delchini, Damien Lebrun-Grandi\'e, and the most important of all
my girlfriend Alison Pawlicki. Without these people, I would not have been
able to accomplish this. 

\indent Lastly, I would like to thank my family. They have always supported and
believed in me. In particular, I would like to thank my Dad who has always
done everything he could to smooth any bump I encountered.
