\addcontentsline{doc}{part}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\indent I would like to thank my advisors Dr. Jean Ragusa and Dr. Jim Morel. 
This work was their idea and they helped me at every step of my research. They 
are a real inspiration to me. I also would like to thank Dr. Wolfgang Bangerth 
for all the useful discussions, we had over the years.

\indent I am also grateful to all the people who made my life in College
Station better: Yaqi Wang, Vijay Mahadevan, Tara Pandya, Michael Adams, Fabien
Auffret, Marco Delchini, Damien Lebrun-Grandie, and the most important of all
my girlfriend Alison Pawlicki. Without these people, I would not have been
able to go to work everyday. 

\indent Lastly, I would like to thank my family. They always supported me and
believed in me. In particular, I would like to thank my dad who has always
done everything he could to smooth any bump I encountered.
